# Key Bindings

This is a complete list of key bindings used by Immersive. Unless explicitly
stated all bindings are specific to a single menu. Keys are organized in
groups, with each specific to one menu.

## Global Bindings

Always available no matter which menu is open, unless there is a binding in
that menu with the same key, in which case that one takes precedence.

All key bindings used by Immersive can be changed in `immersive-keys.conf`
(replace `immersive` with your script ID if it differs).

Each section defines the bindings for one of the groups listed above. Global
entries before the first group set the global bindings. The values follow the
same syntax as mpv's `input.conf` and are passed to the player as-is.
Initialization of invalid bindings silently fails, though it's possible to see
an error message in the console (`Ë‹`).

Example config file:

```
reimport_dicts=Ctrl+r

[target_select]
lookup_partial=Ctrl+ENTER

[sub_select]
instant_export=ENTER
```
